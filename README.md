# Enhanced-MRI-Analysis-for-Brain-Tumour-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
This repository hosts the code and resources for a project focused on MRI analysis for the classification of brain tumours using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset of MRI images of brain tumors, this project aims to develop and implement advanced algorithms to accurately classify different types of brain tumours. our goal is to create a robust classification model capable of accurately identifying different types of brain tumors based on image features extracted from MRI scans.

# Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Scripts and tools for preprocessing MRI images, including normalization, resizing, and noise reduction.

Feature Extraction: Implementation of feature extraction algorithms to extract relevant features from MRI images, such as texture analysis, intensity histograms, and shape descriptors.

Machine Learning Models: Development and evaluation of machine learning models for brain tumor classification, including traditional classifiers like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and advanced deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

Evaluation Metrics: Calculation and visualization of evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of classification models.
# Usage
Download the dataset into your google drive and the fetch the dataset, perform pre-process and EDA and then perform the remaining code to analyse the peformance of the model.

# Contributing
